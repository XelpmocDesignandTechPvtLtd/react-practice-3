what contract do I want to test?

1. Is the onChange spitting out the values in the right format?
2. Is the DropDown using another dropdown component?
3. Does that DropDown have an onchange?
4. On change of the first dropdown, does state get set?
5. On change of the second, does state get set properly?
6. Depending on teh first, are the options to teh second correct?
7.

What do I need to include?

What do I not want to test?

Do I want tests for the DropDown component --> nah I can just include this honestly.
